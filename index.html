        This is a very inspiring virtual self study group offered by &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp" target="_blank"&gt;Boston PHP&lt;/a&gt;.  The concept, format and
        just making sure stuff gets done can be credited to the real Chief Percolator, &lt;a href="http://webapprentices.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gene Babon&lt;/a&gt;

        If you are not a member, join
        &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp" target="_blank"&gt;Boston PHP&lt;/a&gt; today.


        How do our incredible self study groups work? Each participant
        purchases the current book that we are using.  For this season of &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/events/221356927/" target="_blank"&gt;HTML5 Brunch, Season 5&lt;/a&gt;
        we are using 
        &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hours-Teach-Yourself-Updated-HTML5/dp/0672336146/" target="blank"&gt;Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours&lt;/a&gt; by
        &lt;a href="http://www.thickbook.com" target="_blank"&gt;Julie Meloni&lt;/a&gt;.  Each participant reads and completes the excercises according to the current 
        &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/49159834" target="_blank" &gt;Master Discussion List&lt;/a&gt;.  Each participant then
        posts a link to their fantastic completed work in the corresponding message board thread.  Questions and comments are also welcomed from participants.
        Participants can jump in and answer a fellow
        participant's question. The Senior Percolator(That would be me this season.) will scan your awesome work.  Each week
        you will recieve an email updating progress of participants.  There are no classroom meetings. Work from home or your favorite coffee shop.
        Your only cost is this terrific book.  
        Self study groups are great fun and a really fabulous way to learn and improve your coding skills.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;
        Upon successful completion of all work, your name will be chiseled onto the notable 
        &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/bostonphp/messages/boards/thread/21414292" target="_blank"&gt;Self Study Wall of Accomplishments&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a phenomenal
        accomplishment that you to can be a part of.
