		<strong>El Capitan</strong>
				is a 3,000-foot (910 m) vertical rock formation in Yosemite National Park, located on the north side of Yosemite Valley,
				near its western end. The granite monolith is one of the world's favorite challenges for rock climbers.  The formation was named 
				"El Capitan" by the Mariposa Battalion when it explored the valley in 1851.
