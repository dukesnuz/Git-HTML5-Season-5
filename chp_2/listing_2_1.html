		<h3>Listing 2.1</h3>
		<p>
	    In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The Internet was without form and void, and 
	    text was upon the face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. And Tim 
	    said, Let there be links; and there were links. And Tim saw that the links were good; and Tim separated the links from the text. 
	    Tim called the links Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole thing together was the first Web Page.
